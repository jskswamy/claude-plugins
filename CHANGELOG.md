# Changelog

All notable changes to the Claude Code Plugin Marketplace will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-12

### Added

- Add initial changelog for plugin marketplace

Document all notable changes since the initial commit using Keep a
Changelog format. The changelog is generated by git-cliff configured
for classical/imperative commit messages.

Sections included:
- Added: devenv plugin, git-commit plugin, jot plugin, changelog
  automation, and plugin documentation
- Changed: marketplace naming, pre-commit config, devenv enhancements
- Initial Setup: marketplace foundation and development environment
- Removed: welcome message from shell hook

This provides project history visibility and supports the changelog
automation workflow added in commit 346dc78.

### Removed

- Remove automatic Claude co-author attribution from commits

Update the git-commit plugin to only add Co-Authored-By lines when the
--pair flag is explicitly used and a human co-author is selected.

Changes:
- Clarify co-author handling rules in commit command documentation
- Add explicit instruction to never add Claude/Anthropic co-author lines
- Bump version to 1.1.1

This ensures commit messages remain clean and co-authorship reflects
actual pair programming sessions rather than AI assistance.
## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-12

### Added

- Add Devenv Plugin for Nix Flake Management

Introduce the Devenv plugin to initialize and manage Nix flake
development environments easily. This plugin features auto-detection
of project stacks, generates `flake.nix` with best practices, and
integrates security tooling for enhanced safety.

Key features include:

- Auto-detection of project stacks (Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, etc.)
- Pre-commit hooks with SAST tools
- Automatic linting and formatting with nixfmt, statix, and deadnix

Additionally, comprehensive documentation and installation instructions
are provided to streamline user adoption and integration into
development workflows. by @jskswamy
- Add options for secret scanning and fix gitleaks hook

Update the plugin version to 1.0.1 and enhance the documentation
to include options for secret scanning with trufflehog and gitleaks.

The changes also fix the gitleaks pre-commit hook configuration
to enable it as a custom hook, ensuring that secrets can be
properly scanned before commits. This provides users with
flexibility in choosing their secret scanning tool while
maintaining compatibility with the existing setup.

- Added secret scanner preference prompt in the documentation
- Specified the configuration for gitleaks as a custom hook
- Updated keywords for better categorization in plugin.json
- Ensured gitleaks is included in the packages for manual use. by @jskswamy
- Add MCP server support for enhanced Nix package search

This commit introduces support for the MCP server in the Nix
development environment, improving package searchability. The
plugin now integrates with `mcp-nixos`, allowing users to access
over 130K NixOS packages with accurate names and version history
via NixHub.io.

The integration works as follows:
- The plugin first checks for a global or project-level MCP
  configuration to avoid duplicates.
- If not available, it utilizes the bundled MCP server, which
  runs via `nix-shell -p uv`.
- As a fallback, the native `nix search` command is used.

Additionally, users can customize their settings in
`.claude/devenv.local.md` to enable or disable MCP search,
ensuring flexibility in package management. by @jskswamy
- Add git-commit plugin for intelligent commit message generation

Introduce a Claude Code plugin that generates commit messages with
support for classic and conventional commit styles. The plugin
validates atomic commits, detects related unstaged changes, and
supports pair programming attribution.

Features:
- Classic and conventional commit style support
- Strict atomic commit validation with split commit workflow
- Related unstaged/untracked file detection
- Pair programming co-author attribution (--pair flag)
- Configurable preferences via .claude/git-commit.local.md by @jskswamy
- Add session context awareness to commit message generation

The plugin now reviews the conversation history before generating
commit messages to capture the reasoning behind changes.

New Step 6b extracts from the session:
- User's original intent and problem being solved
- Key decisions and trade-offs discussed
- Issue/ticket references mentioned
- Clarifications and scope adjustments

This enables commit messages that explain WHY changes were made, not
just WHAT changed. The diff shows implementation details, but session
context captures the motivation that would otherwise be lost.

Context priority: CLI arguments > session context > diff analysis

Bumps version to 1.1.0 for this feature addition. by @jskswamy
- Add jot plugin for quick knowledge capture

Introduce a Claude Code plugin for low-friction capture of notes,
tasks, ideas, and tech radar blips with Obsidian-style auto-linking.

Key features:
- Single /capture command with type flags (task, note, idea, blip)
- URL-based extraction for articles, videos, people, books, and more
- ThoughtWorks-style tech radar with rings and quadrants
- Auto-linking to related notes via [[wikilinks]]
- Rich content templates targeting 60-120+ lines per capture
- Zettelkasten-inspired book template with reflection prompts
- Configurable workbench path for central storage

All tools and technologies are captured as "blips" (tech radar items)
with comprehensive documentation including features, installation,
usage examples, pros/cons, and alternatives. by @jskswamy
- Add changelog automation with git-cliff and hooks

Implement automated changelog generation using git-cliff configured for
classical/imperative commit messages (not conventional commits).

Changes:
- Add cliff.toml with parsers that categorize commits by imperative
  verbs (Add, Fix, Update, Remove, etc.) into Keep a Changelog sections
- Add pre-push hook in flake.nix that warns about unreleased commits
- Add Claude Code PostToolUse hook that notifies when plugin versions
  change, suggesting changelog updates
- Add jq dependency for JSON processing in hooks

The git-cliff configuration supports the repository's classical commit
style, grouping commits into Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed, and other
standard changelog sections. by @jskswamy
- Add plugin documentation for git-commit and jot

Document the git-commit plugin featuring intelligent commit message
generation with classic/conventional styles, atomic commit validation,
pair programming support, and session context awareness.

Document the jot plugin for quick knowledge capture including tasks,
notes, ideas, session summaries, tech radar blips, and URL-based
captures with Obsidian-style auto-linking.

Update roadmap to reflect completed milestones:
- Git commit helpers (now git-commit plugin)
- Note-taking and knowledge management (now jot plugin) by @jskswamy

### Changed

- Rename marketplace to avoid violating Claude's naming rules

Updated the marketplace name from "claude-plugins" to
"jskswamy-plugins" to comply with the restrictions set by
Claude regarding marketplace names. by @jskswamy
- Update pre-commit configuration in documentation

Revise the documentation for the pre-commit hooks to reflect changes in
the configuration. Specifically, the `trailing-whitespace` and
`end-of-file-fixer` hooks have been replaced with
`trim-trailing-whitespace` for better clarity and functionality.

Additionally, include instructions to update `.gitignore` to exclude
generated files, ensuring a cleaner project structure. This change
aims to streamline the setup process for new developers and improve
the overall maintainability of the project. by @jskswamy
- Update devenv plugin version and enhance direnv support

Upgrade the devenv plugin to version 1.2.0, which includes updates to
the metadata and adds new tags for improved functionality. The tags
now include "direnv" and "direnv-instant" to support enhanced
environment loading options.

Additionally, remove the obsolete settings.local.json file, as it is no
longer needed. The README and command documentation have been updated
to reflect the new direnv-instant integration, allowing for async
environment loading and an instant shell prompt. Detailed setup
instructions for direnv-instant are provided, ensuring a smoother
developer experience when managing Nix flake environments. by @jskswamy
- Allow customization of welcome message style

Added the ability for users to specify how the welcome message
should appear when entering their development environment. The
configuration options include various styles such as `box`,
`minimal`, `project`, `tech`, and `custom`. A custom message
can be set for the `custom` style.

Updated the README and commands documentation to reflect these
changes, providing guidance on how to modify the welcome
message style and text. This enhancement aims to improve
user experience by allowing more personalized greetings. by @jskswamy
- Update version of devenv plugin to 1.3.0

Bump the version of the devenv plugin from 1.2.0 to 1.3.0 in the
marketplace configuration. This update includes improvements and
enhancements that justify the version increment. The plugin helps
initialize and manage Nix flake development environments with
auto-detection and security tooling. by @jskswamy
- Enhance jot plugin with session capture and context features

Add new capture capabilities to support realistic work session workflows:

Session summaries:
- New /capture session command with guided questions
- Captures goal, accomplishments, decisions, lessons, and follow-ups
- Saves to notes/sessions/ directory
- Alias: /capture conversation

Type aliases for reduced friction:
- todo → task
- thought → note
- conversation → session

URL references in quick captures:
- /capture todo use https://example.com/ to do X
- Keeps as quick capture, not full extraction
- Optionally fetches page title only

Automatic session context:
- Silently captures git repo, branch, working directory
- Embedded in all quick captures for context recovery

Optional additional context:
- "Anything else you want to remember?" after discovery context
- User can skip; section omitted if skipped

These features address the need to capture notes, tasks, and session
summaries during active Claude Code sessions without losing the
context needed to regain understanding later. by @jskswamy

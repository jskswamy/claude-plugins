# Vibrant Theme

A bold, energetic theme with high-contrast colors that demand attention. Uses red as the primary accent.

## Usage

Best for:
- Creative portfolios and showcases
- Visual sketchnotes and brainstorming documents
- Marketing and presentation materials
- Documents meant to stand out and engage

## Color Rationale

- **Red primary** (#dc2626) creates immediate visual impact
- **Purple secondary** (#7c3aed) provides complementary accent
- **Warm surface** (#fef2f2) adds subtle warmth without overwhelming
- **Stone text** (#1c1917) grounds the bold colors
- **Saturated chart palette** uses maximum color differentiation for data

## Note

This theme is intentionally bold. Use with templates that benefit from visual energy (portfolio, sketchnote). May be too intense for formal business documents.

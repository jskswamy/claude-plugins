# Dark Theme

A modern dark theme with bright accents on a deep navy background. Reduces eye strain in low-light environments.

## Usage

Best for:
- Screen-first documents (HTML output)
- Developer-focused technical briefs
- Presentations in dark environments
- Creative portfolios with visual impact

## Color Rationale

- **Light blue primary** (#60a5fa) stands out on dark backgrounds
- **Deep navy background** (#0f172a) is easier on eyes than pure black
- **Slate surface** (#1e293b) creates visible card separation
- **Bright chart colors** ensure data visibility on dark backgrounds
- **Light text** (#f1f5f9) provides comfortable contrast ratio

## Note

Dark theme works best with HTML output format. PDF printing may use significant ink.

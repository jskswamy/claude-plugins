# Minimal Theme

An elegant grayscale theme that lets content speak for itself. No color distractions.

## Usage

Best for:
- Academic and research documents
- Documents that will be printed in black and white
- Study guides and educational materials
- Content-heavy documents where color would distract

## Color Rationale

- **Gray primary** (#374151) provides hierarchy without color
- **Pure white background** for maximum clarity
- **Grayscale chart palette** uses value (lightness) for differentiation
- **Subtle borders** (#e5e7eb) separate sections without drawing attention
- **No semantic colors** (success/warning/error all gray) keeps focus on content

## Note

This theme uses font weight and size rather than color for visual hierarchy. Best paired with the study-guide or technical-brief templates.

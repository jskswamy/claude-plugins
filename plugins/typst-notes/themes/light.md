# Light Theme

The default professional theme with a clean blue accent on white background. Optimized for print and screen readability.

## Usage

Best for:
- Executive summaries and business documents
- Meeting minutes and formal notes
- Technical briefs and specifications
- Any document intended for printing

## Color Rationale

- **Primary blue** (#2563eb) provides clear visual hierarchy
- **White background** ensures maximum readability and print compatibility
- **Slate text** (#1e293b) is softer than pure black, reducing eye strain
- **Light surface** (#f8fafc) creates subtle card/section separation
- **Chart palette** spans blue→purple→teal→green→amber for clear data distinction

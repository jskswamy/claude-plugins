### Ring Definitions

- **Adopt**: Actively using in production, confident recommendation for new projects
- **Trial**: Testing in real scenarios, building hands-on experience, promising results
- **Assess**: Worth exploring, researching, learning about - on the radar but not yet tried
- **Hold**: Not recommended, proceed with caution, deprecating, or "wait and see"

### Quadrant Definitions

- **Tools**: Development tools, utilities, applications (Docker, VS Code, Terraform, typos)
- **Techniques**: Methodologies, practices, architectural patterns (TDD, Event Sourcing, GitOps)
- **Platforms**: Infrastructure, runtime, hosting environments (Kubernetes, AWS, Vercel)
- **Languages & Frameworks**: Programming languages, libraries, SDKs (Rust, React, FastAPI)

### Content Requirements

**IMPORTANT: Generate rich, detailed content. Target 80-120+ lines.**

When capturing from a URL (especially GitHub):
1. **Fetch comprehensive data** - README content, features, installation, usage examples
2. **Key Features**: 6+ features with **bold names** and detailed descriptions
3. **Getting Started**: Include actual installation commands
4. **Usage Examples**: 3+ real command examples from documentation
5. **Strengths & Considerations**: 4 strengths, 3 considerations - be specific
6. **Alternatives**: 3+ competing tools with comparison notes

### Data to Extract from GitHub

- **REQUIRED: Ask for ring rationale** - "Why are you placing it at this ring level (Adopt/Trial/Assess/Hold)?"
- **Use user's exact words** for Summary and Ring Rationale sections
- **Use emojis on headings** exactly as shown
- **Generate 5-7 relevant tags** - lowercase, hyphenated
- **Be specific** - include actual commands, features, and metrics
- **Filename**: `slugified-name.md` (no date prefix)
- **Save to**: `notes/blips/`
- Output only markdown, no preamble

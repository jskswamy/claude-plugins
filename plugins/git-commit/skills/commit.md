# Git Commit Action Skill

This skill recognizes when the user wants to **perform** a commit action (not just learn about commits) and invokes the full `/commit` workflow.

## When to Activate

Activate this skill when the user expresses **intent to commit**, such as:

### Direct Commit Requests
- "commit these changes"
- "commit this"
- "let's commit"
- "make a commit"
- "create a commit"
- "commit my work"
- "commit the changes"
- "commit now"

### Readiness Expressions
- "time to commit"
- "ready to commit"
- "I'm ready to commit"
- "let's do the commit"
- "go ahead and commit"

### Action Delegation
- "commit for me"
- "do the commit"
- "please commit"
- "can you commit"
- "would you commit this"
- "commit what I've done"

### Contextual Git Phrases
- "save my changes" (when in git context or after making code changes)
- "save this work" (when in git context)
- "finalize these changes"
- "wrap this up with a commit"

### With Style Preferences
- "commit with conventional style"
- "make a conventional commit"
- "commit this classically"
- "commit using classic style"

### With Context
- "commit this as a bug fix"
- "commit the auth changes"
- "commit what we just did"
- "commit the refactoring"

## What This Skill Does NOT Handle

Do NOT activate for informational questions - those are handled by `commit-style.md`:
- "How do I write a commit message?"
- "What is a conventional commit?"
- "Explain atomic commits"
- "What makes a good commit?"

## Action

When this skill activates, invoke the `/commit` command workflow with any detected context.

### Detecting Style Preference

If the user's request mentions a style preference, pass it to the command:

| User Phrase | Style Flag |
|-------------|------------|
| "conventional commit", "conventional style", "use conventional" | `--style conventional` |
| "classic commit", "classic style", "use classic" | `--style classic` |

### Detecting Amend Intent

If the user wants to amend:
- "amend the commit"
- "update the last commit"
- "fix the previous commit message"

Pass: `--amend`

### Detecting Pair Programming

If user mentions pairing:
- "commit with pair attribution"
- "add my pair"
- "include co-author"

Pass: `--pair`

### Passing Context

Any descriptive text the user provides should be passed as context to help generate a better commit message:

**Example user input:** "commit these auth changes as a security fix"

**Invoke as:** `/commit security fix for auth changes`

## Workflow

1. **Recognize** this is a commit ACTION request
2. **Extract** any style preference, flags, or context from the user's message
3. **Invoke** the `/commit` command with appropriate arguments
4. **Let the command handle** all the complexity:
   - Repository state checking
   - Staging changes if needed
   - Atomic commit validation
   - Style-specific message generation
   - User confirmation flow

## Example Activations

| User Says | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "commit these changes" | Invoke `/commit` |
| "let's make a conventional commit" | Invoke `/commit --style conventional` |
| "commit the login fix" | Invoke `/commit login fix` |
| "time to commit, this fixes the auth bug" | Invoke `/commit fixes auth bug` |
| "commit and add my pair" | Invoke `/commit --pair` |
| "amend the last commit" | Invoke `/commit --amend` |
| "save my changes" (after editing code) | Invoke `/commit` |

## Important

- This skill **overrides** Claude's default commit behavior
- Always use the full `/commit` workflow for proper atomic validation and style adherence
- The `/commit` command handles all edge cases, user preferences, and error scenarios
- Pass through any context the user provides to improve commit message quality

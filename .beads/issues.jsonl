Add jail.nix to security tools selection (alongside pre-commit, gitleaks)\n2. Add sandbox policy options: strict, standard, permissive\n3. Update flake template with jail.nix input\n4. Wrap packages with jail combinators based on policy\n5. Add management menu option for existing environments","design":"## Files to Modify\n\n- plugins/devenv/commands/devenv.md - Add jail.nix to security tools flow\n- plugins/devenv/README.md - Document sandboxing feature\n- plugins/devenv/.claude-plugin/plugin.json - Add keywords\n\n## Flake Template Changes\n\nAdd input:\n```nix\ninputs.jail.url = \"sourcehut:~alexdavid/jail.nix\";\n```\n\nInitialize in outputs:\n```nix\njail = inputs.jail.lib.init pkgs;\n```\n\nWrap packages:\n```nix\npackages = with pkgs; [\n  (jail.wrap nodejs [ jail.network ])\n  (jail.wrap python3 [ jail.network (jail.readonly \"/etc\") ])\n];\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nAdd to .claude/devenv.local.md:\n```yaml\nuse_jail_sandbox: false\njail_policy: standard  # strict, standard, permissive\n```\n\n## Policy Presets\n\n- strict: No network, no GUI, minimal filesystem\n- standard: Network access, read-only common paths\n- permissive: Network + GUI + GPU access","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] jail.nix appears in security tools selection during init\n- [ ] User can choose sandbox policy (strict/standard/permissive)\n- [ ] Generated flake.nix includes jail.nix input when selected\n- [ ] Packages wrapped with appropriate combinators per policy\n- [ ] Existing environments can add sandboxing via manage flow\n- [ ] Configuration persisted in devenv.local.md\n- [ ] nix flake check passes with jail.nix integration\n- [ ] README documents jail.nix feature","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"jskswamy@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:49:18.079001+05:30","created_by":"Krishnaswamy Subramanian","updated_at":"2026-01-15T01:07:28.948534+05:30"}
